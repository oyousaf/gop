        The growing discourse around divesting in Israeli products and companies
        supporting Israel has gained momentum, especially during the current
        crisis. Esteemed Islamic scholars are advocating for Muslims to avoid
        such brands, highlighting the profound spiritual and historical
        significance of Masjid Al-Aqsa, one of Islamâ€™s holiest sites. In light
        of the suffering faced by our Muslim brothers and sisters in Palestine,
        it becomes a moral obligation to divest in not only Israeli goods but
        also businesses that align with their actions. Collective efforts are
        vital to demonstrate unity and uphold shared values.
